# Introduction

This document introduces some convenience functions to query [clickstream data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickstream) from a [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.org/) instance.

```{r}
# Set global knitr Options
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, tidy = FALSE, results = 'asis')
```

### Preparations

---------

```{r}
# Clean wd
rm(list=ls())

# Packages
packages <- c("rmongodb", "jsonlite", "data.table", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "scales")
for(package in packages) if(!require(package, character.only=TRUE)) install.packages(package)

# Load helper functions
source("/home/vagrant/helper_functions_clickstream.R")
```

### Source data 

---------

I've written a couple of convenience functions to quickly get the tables / collections stored in a mongodb instance. This way, it's easy to loop over a list of table/collection names and query data. 

Below, you'll find the sample code to quickly query table names

```{r}
# Check tables in mongodb
tables <- mongoMeta(return.type = "tables")
```

Similarly, you can query names of collections within a table

```{r}
# Check collections in table
collections <- mongoMeta(return.type = "collections", table = tables[1])
```

One benefit of working with mongo is that there are several operations that can be performed without loading the data in memory. For example, if you want to query data about user interactions with videos for a course, you can query all unique URLs, format them nicely in R, and loop over them to get the data you want.

Below, you will see one way of doing this

```{r}
# Query unique URLs
mongo <- mongo.create()
if(mongo.is.connected(mongo) == TRUE) {
  urls <- as.character(mongo.distinct(mongo, collections[1], "page_url", query = list('key' = "user.video.lecture.action")))
}
# Disconnect
mongo.destroy(mongo)
# Check
urls
```

Every video has multiple urls. So, when a user selects either the flash or html5 player it creates a different URL, e.g.

```{r}
knitr::kable(as.data.frame(urls[which(grepl("lecture_id=35", urls))]))
```

So we select each of these URLs and query the data for them. Since we are interested in the *user actions* with the video, we can construct a single call that will return these actions in one go. (**NOTE: There are probably more efficient ways of doing this, but it gets the job done**). 

```{r}
# Select urls of interest
urls_of_interest <- urls[which(grepl("lecture_id=35", urls))]
# Time the action
time.now <- Sys.time()
# For each url, return a data frame with user actions
res <- lapply(urls_of_interest, function(x){
  return(QueryuserActions(collections[1], x, return.type="data.frame", include.username=TRUE))
})
# Runtime
Sys.time() - time.now
# Bind results into 1 dataframe
res <- rbindlist(res)
```

For an overview of the variables, see the [Coursera help pages](https://partner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/203586039-Manual-Data-Exports?flash_digest=141b196433d7edc8d30cb07c1c79a77a36bf7043)

### Visualize data

-------

The *currentTime* and *prevTime* variables are given in a sort of 'epoch time' format. You can convert them to video time with the function below. 

```{r}
# Convert currentTime & PrevTime
res$currentTime.conv <- sapply(res$currentTime, vidTime)
```

By aggregating actions per time stamp, we can plot when which action occurred:

```{r}
# Aggregate by timestamp / action type
agg <- res %>%
  group_by(currentTime.conv, type) %>%
  tally
# Convert to datetime
agg$datetime <- as.POSIXct(agg$currentTime.conv, format= "%H:%M:%S")
# Plot
ggplot(as.data.frame(agg), aes(x=datetime, y=n, group=type, colour=type)) +
  geom_line(size=1.5, alpha=0.8) +
  scale_x_datetime(breaks = "1 min",
                   labels = date_format("%M:%S")) +
  theme_bw()
```

You should see "spikes" of pauses & plays occurring at the beginning of the video and whenever questions are asked.

From here, you can start sorting noise from signal and other more complicated procedures.
