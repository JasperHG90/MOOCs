# Introduction

This document briefly outlines how you can use R to access MySQL databases.

```{r}
# Set global knitr Options
require(knitr)
opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, tidy = FALSE, results = 'asis')
```

# Connecting to the database

Firstly, make sure that MySQL is running by opening up a terminal and executing the following line:

 - sudo /usr/local/mysql/support-files/mysql.server start

In R, you need to install the "RMySQL" package, which you can do as follows

```{r}
# Install packages
install.packages("RMySQL")
# Load
library(RMySQL)
```

```{r}
# Specify credentials
usern = "root"
dbname = "terror001"
password = ""
con = dbConnect(MySQL(), username=usern, dbname=dbname, password = password)
dbListTables(con)
dbDisconnect(con)
