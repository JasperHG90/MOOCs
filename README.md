## Introduction

This repository contains semi-cleaned scripts and documentation which you can use to pre-process Coursera MOOC data dumps. It further contains several "helper functions" which could be useful for working with these data. Most of the scripts have been written in the R statistical Language or Python.

### Using these scripts

The scripts in this repository are 'semi-cleaned'. i.e. I've written them primarily for my own convenience, but they should be adaptable to your own data. Any feedback is hugely appreciated. After all, sharing is caring :-).
