## Introduction

This repository contains semi-cleaned scripts and documentation which you can use to pre-process Coursera MOOC data dumps. It further contains several "helper functions" which could be useful for working with these data. Most of the scripts have been written in the R statistical Language or Python.

### Using these scripts

The scripts in this repository are 'semi-cleaned'. i.e. I've written them primarily for my own convenience, but they should be adaptable to your own data. Any feedback is hugely appreciated. After all, sharing is caring :-).

The scripts are organized along the lines of the data dumps provided by Coursera. That is to say that each folder corresponds to a specific dataset, and each script within those folders pertains especially to those data. "General" helper functions are provided in the 'general_and_workflow'-folder. For a more specific overview of the folders, please see the section 'Folder structure' below.
